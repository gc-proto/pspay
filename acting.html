  <h2 id="toc1">How  acting pay is calculated</h2>
    <p>Acting pay is the rate of pay that you would be paid on  appointment to a higher classification level, as calculated following the  promotion or deployment rules set out in section A2.2 (Rate of pay) of the <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15772">Directive on Terms and Conditions of Employment</a>.</p>
    <p>The promotion pay rate calculation rules are used to  determine your acting positon&rsquo;s pay level. A promotion, for pay calculation  purposes, occurs when the maximum pay level of the position you are acting in  exceeds the maximum pay level of your substantive position by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the lowest pay increment of the new position, or</li>
        <li>4% of the rate of the new position if there is only one  rate of pay, or</li>
        <li>4% of the maximum rate of the new position where the  appointment is to a group governed by performance pay (for example AS-08,  PE-06, FI-04)</li>
      </ul>
  <p>For more information, consult sections <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15772#cla2.2.2.3">2.2.2.3</a>, <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15772#cla2.2.2.4">2.2.2.4</a> and <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15772#cla2.2.2.5">2.2.2.5</a> of the <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15772">Directive on Terms and Conditions of Employment</a>.</p>

		<h3>Note</h3>
		  <p>Certain job classifications have specific  calculations identified in their terms and conditions of employment or salary  administration plan relative to their appointments. Consult with your manager  or human resources advisor or refer to your <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/agreements-conventions/index-eng.aspx">collective agreement</a> for more  information.</p>

<h2 id="toc2">Acting roles and the Pay Centre</h2>
  <p>Unless the case is considered an <a href="/remuneration-compensation/services-paye-pay-services/paye-centre-pay/guide-reference-job-aid-eng.html#x1">acting pay exception</a>, the Pay  Centre does not require any further documentation to process an acting  extension. For more information, consult with your manager or human resources  advisor.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="toc3">Pay increments and revisions</h2>
    <p>While in an acting role, you will continue to receive normal  pay increments in your substantive pay level. Depending on your substantive pay  level, you may also be entitled to receive pay increments in your current  acting pay level. For more information, consult sections <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15772#cla2.6.4.1">2.6.4.1</a>, <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15772#cla2.6.4.2">2.6.4.2</a> of the <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15772">Directive on Terms and Conditions of Employment</a>.</p>
    <p>If you do receive a pay increment in your substantive pay  level, your current acting pay level will be recalculated and adjusted  accordingly. If this results in a current acting pay level that is less than  your new increased substantive pay level, you will continue to receive the same  current acting pay level. For more information, consult section <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15772#cla2.6.3.1">2.6.3.1</a> of the <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15772">Directive on Terms and Conditions of Employment</a>.</p>
    <p>You are entitled to any revision in the pay level of your  current acting role. For more information, consult sections <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15772#cla2.6.3.1">2.6.3.1</a>, <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15772#cla2.6.3.2">2.6.3.2</a> and <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15772#cla2.3.1">2.3.1</a> of the <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15772">Directive on Terms and Conditions of Employment</a>.</p>

<section>
<h2 id="toc4">Acting groups </h2>
  <p>While in an acting role, you are subject to the terms and  conditions of employment and the collective agreement of the acting group. If you  are acting in the Executive Group, you remain covered by the terms and  conditions of employment or the collective agreement of your substantive  position; however, you will not be entitled to overtime, call back, reporting  pay, standby, shift premiums, travelling time or any other cash compensation  which is dependent on completing a specified number of hours in a normal work week.  For more information, consult sections <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15772#cla2.6.8.1">2.6.8.1</a> and <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15772#cla2.6.8.2">2.6.8.2</a> of the <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15772">Directive on Terms and Conditions of Employment</a></p>

<section>
<h2 id="toc5">Calculating pay for a subsequent acting appointments</h2>
  <p>While in an acting appointment, if your role shifts to a  more senior acting level, your pay level will be calculated using your substantive  salary. If this results in a pay level that is less than your original acting pay  level, you will be paid at the rate that is nearest to, but not less than your original  acting pay level.</p>
  <p>When you return to your original acting role, you will revert  back to your original acting pay level.</p>
  <p>For more information, consult <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15772#cla2.6.5">2.6.5 b</a> of the <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15772">Directive on Terms and Conditions of Employment</a>.</p>

<section>
  <h2 id="toc6">Promotions and deployments (while in an acting position)</h2>
  <p>If you are promoted or deployed while acting in a  position, your promotion/deployment pay level will be calculated using your new substantive  salary. </p>
  <p>Refer to section <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15772#cla2.6.6">2.6.6</a>, subsection <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15772#cla2.6.6.1">2.6.6.1</a> and <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15772#cla2.6.6.2">2.6.6.2</a> of the <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15772">Directive on Terms and Conditions of Employment</a> to  find out how your new acting salary is established based on your specific  scenario.</p>
