      <p>As an employee, you receive payment in arrears. This means you get paid for the weeks you have already worked.</p>
      <p><strong>Payday is every second Wednesday</strong>. Your pay is for work completed up to and including the end of the day 2&nbsp;Wednesdays before. This means that you get paid for 10&nbsp;days, from Thursday to Wednesday, for work that concluded 2&nbsp;weeks previously.</p>

      <h4 id="a5">How you get paid</h4>
      <p>The  government uses <strong>direct deposit</strong> to electronically transfer your pay to  your bank account. Using direct deposit is a condition of employment. Exceptions  may be made only if there is a specific reason why you can&rsquo;t use direct  deposit.</p>
      <p>You may modify your banking information through the  employee self-serve option in Phoenix. If you are unable to modify your direct  deposit information in Phoenix, you may complete and send  the direct deposit enrolment request form, along with a void cheque, to the Pay  Centre. If your organization isn&rsquo;t served by the Pay Centre, contact your compensation  team.</p>
      <p>It is important that you keep your current bank  account active until you can confirm that your pay is being deposited into your  new account.</p>

      <h4 id="a6">Tax slips</h4>
      <p>The method of calculating income tax at source is  very effective. Unless you have other issues that affect your income tax  situation, such as income from another source, the amount of income tax  deducted will closely relate to the amount of income received during the tax  year.</p>
      <p>The  amounts reported on your tax slips (T4 slip or <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Relevé</span> 1) include the sum of your gross earnings for the  calendar year and the deductions taken at source from those earnings. If you earned  any taxable benefits from employment during the year, the value of these  benefits also appears on your tax slips. Your tax slips will reflect regular  and supplementary payments you received during the year, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>retroactive revision</li>
        <li>retroactive promotion</li>
        <li>pay out of annual or extra duty leave</li>

  <section>
    <h4 id="a7">Change in net pay</h4>
    <p>A change to your net pay may occur for many reasons. Each personal income situation is unique. Some of the factors to consider are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>changes to your province of work  or residence</li>
      <li>changes to salary</li>
      <li>source deductions</li>
      <li>taxable allowances and benefits</li>
      <li>personal tax credits</li>
      <li>hardship or other exemptions</li>
      <li>leave without pay</li>
      <li>overpayment recoveries</li>
    </ul>
    <section>
      <h5>Personal income tax</h5>
      <p>Your tax deductions at source are based on your province of work and the income tax rates in effect at the time of the payment. If provincial or federal tax rates change, you may notice a change to your net pay.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h5>Public Service Pension Plan contributions</h5>
      <p>At the beginning of each year, the lower rate of the 2&nbsp;possible contribution rates to the Public Service Pension Plan applies until you reach the maximum contribution level for that rate. As a result, the higher contribution rate applies for the remainder of the year. If you, as a contributor under the Public Service Pension Plan, compare your last pay in December to your first pay in January, you may notice that you paid a greater amount to the plan in December.</p>
      <p>Contributions  to the Public Service Pension Plan have a direct bearing on the income tax  deducted at source. These contributions are deducted from your gross pay before  determining the tax rate. The larger the Public Service Pension Plan  contribution, the lesser the amount of income tax withheld from your pay.</p>
      <p>Upon completing  35&nbsp;years of pensionable service, your contribution rate falls to 1%. In  addition, the Public Service Pension Plan contributions continue until the end  of the calendar year in which you reach age&nbsp;71. As mentioned above, as  soon as your contributions to the Public Service Pension Plan fall, your income  tax deduction will increase.</p>

      <p>Each calendar year, <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr>/<abbr title="Québec Pension Plan">QPP</abbr> contributions must be deducted from earnings until a maximum level is achieved. Depending on your earnings, you may reach the maximum level of <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> and <abbr title="Québec Pension Plan">QPP</abbr> contributions sometime during the year. If or when this happens, you will notice that <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr>/<abbr title="Québec Pension Plan">QPP</abbr> deductions are no longer being withheld. At the start of a new calendar year, <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr>/<abbr title="Québec Pension Plan">QPP</abbr> deductions will begin again.</p>
      <p>Contributions to <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> end at age&nbsp;70 even if you have not stopped working. As a result, your net pay will increase at that time. Meanwhile, if you work in Quebec, you must continue contributing to the <abbr title="Québec Pension Plan">QPP</abbr> even after aged&nbsp;70, until the <abbr title="Québec Pension Plan">QPP</abbr> maximum contribution is reached for each year.</p>

      <h5>Québec Parental Insurance Plan (QPIP)</h5>
      <p>Each calendar year, <abbr title="Québec Parental Insurance Plan">QPIP</abbr> premiums must be deducted from earnings until a maximum level is achieved. Depending on your earnings, you may reach the maximum <abbr title="Québec Parental Insurance Plan">QPIP</abbr> premiums required sometime during the year. When this happens, you will notice an increase in your net pay because the <abbr title="Québec Parental Insurance Plan">QPIP</abbr> premiums are no longer being withheld. At the start of a new calendar year, <abbr title="Québec Parental Insurance Plan">QPIP</abbr> deductions will resume and continue until you pay the maximum <abbr title="Québec Parental Insurance Plan">QPIP</abbr> premiums for that year.</p>

		  <p>Under certain circumstances, you may request a reduction in the amount of income tax to be withheld from your pay by your employer. You may apply in writing to the District Taxation Office at Canada Revenue Agency or to Revenue Quebec, providing details of your situation. If approved, you will receive a “letter of authority” to this effect.</p>
        <p>If Public  Service Pay Centre serves your organization, send it a copy of this letter,  along with a <a href="/remuneration-compensation/services-paye-pay-services/form/html/446-5-eng.html">pay  action request form</a>,  to ensure that it makes the appropriate adjustments to the income taxes  withheld from your salary.</p>
        <p>If you  work in Quebec and live in Ontario, New Brunswick or Nova Scotia, you may ask  to have the Cross Province indicator activated in Phoenix. Once this is done,  you will pay provincial income tax according to the applicable rates for your province  of residence rather than the higher Quebec rates. In all other circumstances, you  need to obtain a letter of authority from your tax services office.</p>
        <p>Conversely,  if you live in one province but report to a place of business in another, you may  not have enough tax deducted. If this is the case, you may &ldquo;request more tax  deductions&rdquo; by completing the federal TD1 form and sending it to compensation.</p>
