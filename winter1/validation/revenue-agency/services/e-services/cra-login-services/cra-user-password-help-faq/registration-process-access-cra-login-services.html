</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



     <h2 id="hlp2">3. What do you mean by current postal code or ZIP code?</h2>
<p>As part of your personal authentication information, you will have to enter the postal code or ZIP code of your current mailing address. If you live outside Canada and the United States, the postal code or ZIP code is not required. The postal code or ZIP code field is not case sensitive and may or may not include spaces or dashes.</p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



     <h2 id="hlp3">4. How do I get a CRA security code?</h2>
<p>If you have completed the registration process through My Account for Individuals, My Business Account, the MyCRA app, MyBenefits CRA app, or the CRA BizApp, you will be issued a CRA security code. The CRA security code has an indicated expiry date. Follow the provided instructions before the code expires, or you will have to contact the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/telephone-numbers.html#h5">Individual tax enquiries</a> to have a new CRA security code issued to you.</p>
<p>If you choose to have the code mailed, we will mail it to the address we have on file. <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services/cra-user-password-help-faqs/registration-process-access-cra-login-services.html#hlp9">Have you moved recently</a>?

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



     <h2 id="hlpscrtycd">5. Where do I enter my CRA security code?</h2>
<p>Once you receive your new CRA security code, return to the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services.html">CRA login services page</a>, and select the service you registered with. If you registered for a CRA user ID and password, select the CRA login option, or, if you registered using the Sign-in Partner service, select the Sign-in Partner option. Follow the online instructions, and enter your CRA security code when prompted.</p>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



     <h2 id="hlpnrrn">6. How do I get a non-resident representative number (NRRN)?</h2>
<p>A non-resident representative number (NRRN) is a number issued to non-resident individuals living in the United States who would like to use the Represent a Client service to access information and services on behalf of individuals and businesses. To apply for an NRRN, you must submit <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc391.html">Form RC391, Application for a Canada Revenue Agency Non-Resident Representative Number (NRRN)</a>, and provide supporting documentation to prove your identity. We will mail you a letter with your NRRN and instructions on how to use your NRRN to register for Represent a Client.</p>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



     <h2 id="hlp4">7. Can I use the same user ID and password to access all the CRA login services?</h2>
